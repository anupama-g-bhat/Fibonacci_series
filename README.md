# ðŸ”¢ Fibonacci Series in Python

This is a simple Python program that prints the Fibonacci series up to `n` terms. The Fibonacci sequence starts with `0` and `1`, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- Takes user input for how many Fibonacci numbers to generate.
- Initializes the first two numbers: `a = 0`, `b = 1`.
- Uses a `for` loop to calculate and print the series.

### ðŸ§ª Sample Output

- Enter how many terms of the Fibonacci series you want to display: 8
- 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 

## ðŸ’¡ Future Plans

- Plot the Fibonacci sequence using matplotlib.
- Save the output to a `.txt` file.
- Add option to calculate nth Fibonacci number only.
